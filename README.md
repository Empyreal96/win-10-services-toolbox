# Windows 10 Toolkit

**Windows-Toolkit.cmd**  - An ever-growing toolkit to modify many aspects of Windows written in Batch

**Supported Versions** = Windows 10 64/32 Bit and ARM64, I use on Pro 64bit+ARM64 and Home 32bit+ARM64.

**Any Risks?** = There will _always_ be risk when modifying parts of Windows, make a Restore Point beforehand if worried.

**Requirements** = Access to Admin privileges. Some common sense.

**Please add your suggestions for what I should add to it in the Issues Tab, along with any bugs**
